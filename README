# Opera FTM Network - Bulk TX

This script goal is to help you generate bulk payment on [Fantom Opera Mainnet](https://fantom.foundation/
). As TXs cost is very very low, this script is not creating a smart contract to send a bulk transaction but sends multiple tx, one by one. 

## Installation

Clone the repository and install nodejs dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

## Configuration

Rename the `config_template.json` to `config.json`. Update your `private_key`, `public_key` and `receivers` wallets and amounts to receive.

Note that all amounts are in human readable formats, not base 18.



## Usage

Once the config file is updated and saved, just launch the nodejs script as is :

```bash
node index.js
```
